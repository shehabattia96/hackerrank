# Solving hackerrank challenges

I enjoy coding puzzles, these are great challenges that used up some brain-cycles.

## Return code: SUCESS

> Challenges I attempted successfully

- [Queen's Attack 2](./queens-attack-2/) - Calculating all the possible moves a Chess queen piece could make. I found a way to solve this using algebra instead of bruteforcing a 2D array.
- [Grading](./grading/grading.cpp) - Curving students' grades. I wish my professors were so lax with rounding up grades.
- [Apples and Oranges](./apple-and-orange/apple-and-orange.cpp) - Counting how many fruits fall a specific distance away from a tree. This was more of a math problem than a programming one.
- [Sum of Multiples of 3 and 5](./multiples-of-3-and-5/) - Finding multiples of 3 and 5 up to 10^9 and adding them up. I attempted bruteforcing this but then found a more efficient equation. I should have looked for an equation from the beginning.
- [Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers](./even-fibonacci-numbers/) - Learned about the Golden Ratio and looked for an equation before trying to bruteforce a solution (which wouldn't have been very wise anyway!)
- [Largest Prime Factor](./largest-prime-factor/) - This was tricky because I found several misleading algorithms that didn't provide the answer I needed. Ended up using a bruteforce method and optimizing it a little so it runs faster than O(n).
