# Number of Islands

**Time to solve (metric to improve on in the future!):** 35mins

**Date solved:** 6/7/2023

**Score:** 100, 160ms runtime which is a bit on the slower side.

**Notes:**
Used pair<int,int> with a map to navigate 2D array instead of keeping track of a 2D array for visited locations, which may be slowing things down a fair bit.
